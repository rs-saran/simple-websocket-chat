## JavaScript Functionality

### 1. **Socket Initialization**
- When the 'Start Chat Session' button is clicked, a WebSocket connection is established using Socket.IO.
- Events like `connect`, `disconnect`, and message reception are handled to update the UI.

### 2. **Message Handling**
- When a user sends a message, it is displayed in the chat box and sent to the server via WebSocket.
- Responses from the bot are displayed dynamically.
- System messages (e.g., connection status) are shown distinctly.

### 3. **Chat Session Management**
- The chat session starts when the user clicks 'Start Chat Session' and ends when 'End Chat Session' is clicked.
- UI elements like input fields and buttons are enabled/disabled accordingly.
