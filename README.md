# Flask-SocketIO WebSocket Application Reference

## Overview
This document serves as a reference guide for building WebSocket-based applications using Flask-SocketIO. The provided Flask application manages WebSocket connections, handles real-time user messages, and includes a background task to send periodic notifications.

---

## Features
1. **WebSocket Communication**: Uses Flask-SocketIO to handle real-time user interactions.
2. **Active Session Tracking**: Maintains a list of connected users.
3. **Message Handling**: Receives and responds to user messages.
4. **Automated Background Task**: Sends hydration reminders every even minute.
5. **CORS Support**: Allows cross-origin communication.

---

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Application Setup**
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
```
- Creates a Flask app instance.
- Configures a secret key for security.
- Initializes Flask-SocketIO with CORS enabled.

---

### 2. **Tracking Active Sessions**
```python
active_sessions = {}
```
- A dictionary to store active WebSocket connections.
- Keys: Session IDs (assigned by Flask-SocketIO).
- Values: Timestamps for connection and last activity.

---

### 3. **Handling WebSocket Connections**
#### **User Connects**
```python
@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    session_id = request.sid
    active_sessions[session_id] = {
        'connected_at': datetime.datetime.now(),
        'last_activity': datetime.datetime.now()
    }
    emit('system_message', {'text': 'Connected to server'})
```
- When a user connects, their session ID is stored in `active_sessions`.
- Sends a system message confirming the connection.

#### **User Disconnects**
```python
@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    session_id = request.sid
    active_sessions.pop(session_id, None)
```
- Removes the user from `active_sessions` upon disconnection.

---

### 4. **Handling Incoming Messages**
```python
@socketio.on('user_message')
def handle_message(data):
    session_id = request.sid
    if session_id in active_sessions:
        active_sessions[session_id]['last_activity'] = datetime.datetime.now()
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
        emit('bot_message', {'text': f"{data['text']} rcvd at {timestamp} (dummy reply)"})
```
- Receives a message from the user.
- Updates their last activity timestamp.
- Sends a dummy response with a timestamp.

---

### 5. **Background Task for Periodic Notifications**
```python
def send_hydration_reminders():
    while True:
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        if now.minute % 2 == 0 and now.second == 0:
            for session_id in list(active_sessions.keys()):
                try:
                    socketio.emit('bot_message', {
                        'text': f"Remember to stay hydrated! It's {now.strftime('%H:%M')}"
                    }, room=session_id)
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error sending reminder to {session_id}: {e}")
        time.sleep(1)
```
- Runs in a separate thread.
- Sends hydration reminders every even minute to active users.
- Uses `socketio.emit` to send messages.

---

### 6. **Starting the Application**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    reminder_thread = threading.Thread(target=send_hydration_reminders, daemon=True)
    reminder_thread.start()
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True, allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True)
```
- Starts the background thread for reminders.
- Runs the Flask-SocketIO app.
- Sets host to `0.0.0.0` to allow external access.

---

## Summary
- Flask-SocketIO provides real-time WebSocket communication.
- The app maintains active sessions and updates last activity timestamps.
- Messages from users are acknowledged with timestamps.
- A background task sends hydration reminders every even minute.
- Flask-SocketIOâ€™s `emit` function is used to send messages to specific users.

This setup can be used for building interactive chat applications, real-time dashboards, or event-driven systems.


## Flask vs. FastAPI for WebSockets

## Why Use Flask Instead of FastAPI for This Use Case?

### 1. **Better WebSocket Support with Flask-SocketIO**
- Flask-SocketIO provides an easy-to-use abstraction for WebSockets.
- It supports rooms, background tasks, and broadcasting efficiently.
- FastAPI relies on `asyncio` for WebSockets, making it more complex for event-driven applications.

### 2. **Threading and Background Tasks**
- Flask-SocketIO allows background tasks with threading (`threading.Thread`).
- FastAPI relies on `asyncio.create_task()`, which can be harder to manage for periodic tasks like reminders.
- Flask-SocketIO integrates seamlessly with message queues (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.) for large-scale WebSocket handling.

### 3. **Ease of Integration with Frontend**
- Flask-SocketIO provides built-in CORS handling, making it easier to connect with frontend clients.
- It has better support for emitting and receiving real-time events compared to FastAPI's native WebSocket handling.

### 4. **Mature Ecosystem & Simplicity**
- Flask has been around longer and has a vast number of extensions.
- Flask-SocketIO simplifies real-time communication, whereas FastAPI requires more manual work with `WebSocket` endpoints.

### When to Use FastAPI Instead?
- If the project requires high-performance REST APIs alongside WebSockets.
- If you need async database queries (e.g., PostgreSQL with `asyncpg`).
- If you want built-in OpenAPI documentation.

---

## Conclusion
For a WebSocket-driven application with real-time features like chat, notifications, or event streaming, **Flask-SocketIO is a better choice** due to its simplicity, built-in event handling, and background task support. FastAPI is more suited for high-performance APIs but requires more complexity for WebSockets.
